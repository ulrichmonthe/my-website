They enjoy learning about the nuances of various whiskey styles, from Scotch to bourbon, and often seek out unique bottles with distinct flavors and histories. Their collection may consist of affordable, readily available brands alongside a few rare or limited-edition bottles theyâ€™ve discovered through research or recommendations.
